On the 23rd of April 2024, i began to code the layout of the calculator first. The History button taking the right side of the application with the various number buttons and operators occupying the body.

The content of what should be in the history is the *Date* , *Input*, and *Result*.

**Tools used include**

*Bootstrap Framework* , *Tailwindcss*

**CHALLENGES**

*1. When clicking on the icons gotten from font Awesome, it does display on the calculator input*

***Solution***: After reaching out to Sir Ifeanyi our Tutor, i realised that Icons doesnt display but instead i should use the utf html code which displayed after putting it in my code.


*2. Dot symbol implementation and logic; Use cases like*

*   2..4
*   2.3 + 43

***Solution***: I decided to create a fresh script to do the basic logic without related to DOM, which help me achieved that.



***Solution***
